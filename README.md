# advisor

## Run
Default environment is `dev`:
```bash
uv run advisor # explicit environment
uv run advisor --env prod
uv run advisor --env test # mock LLM, no network required
```

## Commands
Five focused commands, each targeting one role in the pipeline:
- `ask` — single step: send a question directly to the generic executor, no planning
- `plan` — call the Planner and print goal + step titles
- `exec` — execute all plan steps **only through the OCR Executor** (no critic validation)
- `critic` — review all executed steps sequentially, stopping at the first failure
- `ocr_flow` — full PEC pipeline: `plan` → `exec` → `critic` runs in a single continuous execution. **Important:** The final extraction result is returned in **YAML format** (instead of JSON) for improved readability and compliance with medical standards.

## Tests
```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

## Usage

### ask
Calls the generic executor directly with the user request. No planning, no review loop.
```bash
uv run advisor --env dev ask "Summarize why we keep LLM adapters vendor-agnostic."
```

### plan

Calls the Planner and prints the structured goal and step titles. Expects LLM to return valid `PlanResult` JSON; exits with *code 2* on failure.

```bash
uv run advisor --env dev plan "docs/medocs/2023-02-23_ecg.json" > "docs/fixtures/2023-02-23_ecg.yaml"

uv run advisor --env dev plan "docs/medocs/Затейчук_В_Е_2025_03_21_консультация_ЛОРа.txt" > "docs/fixtures/Затейчук_В_Е_2025_03_21_консультация_ЛОРа.yaml"

```

### exec

Execute all plan steps through the OCR Executor **without critic validation**. Useful for debugging the executor in isolation or running extraction without validation. Requires a pre-generated plan context file (produced by `plan` command or manually crafted).

```bash
uv run advisor --env dev exec "docs/fixtures/2023-02-23_ecg.yaml" > ecg.yaml

# export exec-result to ultrasound.yaml and application log to exec_step.log
uv run advisor --env dev exec "docs\fixtures\ctx_ultrasound.yaml" > ultrasound.yaml 2>exec_step.log
```

### critic

Review all executed steps sequentially. Stops at the first rejected step.

```bash
uv run advisor --env dev critic @docs/fixtures/ctx_ecg.yaml
```

### ocr_flow
Full pipeline: `plan` → `exec` → `critic` in one continuous run.
```bash
uv run advisor --env dev ocr_flow "docs/medocs/2023-02-23_ecg.json"
```

## Configuration
- `config/<env>/app.yaml` — LLM provider, DB path, prompts directory
- `config/<env>/models.yaml` — role-to-model mapping (`planner`, `ocr_executor`, `critic`)
- `prompts/<role>/system.md` + `user.md` — role system prompts and user templates

## Environments
- `test` — mock LLM, no network, used in CI and unit tests
- `dev` — OpenAI-compatible proxy at `localhost:4000`, for local development
- `prod` — OpenAI-compatible proxy at `localhost:4000`, for production use
